# Rules documentation

The [Rules module](http://drupal.org/project/rules) allows site administrators to define conditionally executed
actions based on occurring events (ECA-rules).

## How to contribute to the documentation

You can contribute directly on [our repository](https://github.com/fubhy/rules-docs) by editing the files through the
GitHub interface directly in your browser. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and edit the book in your
favorite text editor or in the official [GitBook desktop app](https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor/blob/master/README.md).
The desktop app has a live preview option.
