# Rules Documentation

Note: This documentation can be read online at [docs.d8rules.org](http://docs.d8rules.org/).

## Introduction

The [Rules module](http://drupal.org/project/rules) allows site administrators to build flexible workflows using events, conditions, and actions (known as reactive or [ECA rules](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_condition_action)).

Rules can react to events occurring on your site, such as a user logging in or a node being submitted, and it can perform customized follow-up actions such as redirecting to a certain page or setting field values.

Rules is also a framework used by other modules, allowing them to expose user-configurable components with sets of actions and conditions that are managed in easy to import/export configuration files. Rules leverages Entity API to read and act on data and work seamlessly with all types of variables and entities.
