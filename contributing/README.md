Contributing
------------

For some time development will happen on GitHub and will be using the pull
request model: In case you are not familiar with that, please take a few minutes
to read the [GitHub article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
about that topic.

There are a few conventions that should be followed when contributing:

* Always create an issue in the [drupal.org Rules issue queue](http://drupal.org/project/issues/rules)
  for every pull request you are working on.
* Always cross-reference the Issue in the Pull Request and the Pull Request in
  the Issue.
* Always create a new branch for every pull request: its name should contain a
  brief summary of the ticket and its issue id, e.g **readme-2276369**.
* Try to keep the history of your pull request as clean as possible by squashing
  your commits: you can look at the [Symfony documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cmf/contributing/commits.html)
  or at the [Git book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages)
  for more information on how to do that.
